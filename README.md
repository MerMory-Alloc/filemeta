# File Metadata Microservice
This project implements a file upload feature using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The client-side code, written in JavaScript, allows users to select a file for upload. The server, built with Express.js and Multer, receives the file, performs basic validation such as limiting the file size, and responds with metadata such as the file name, type, and size. This project serves as one of the required projects for the FreeCodeCamp course "Back End Development and APIs" certification, showcasing practical skills in handling file uploads and server-side processing.
